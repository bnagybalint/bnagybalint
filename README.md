Hi, I'm Balint and I like to create stuff.

I'm a coder and (an aspiring) software architect, in the past I've created multiple desktop applications, games, backend services, and data-processing tools.

I'm currently learning frontend development in order to be able to create web applications from the data layer all the way up to the UI.
